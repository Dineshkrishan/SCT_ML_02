Implement K-Means Clustering Algorithm

K-Means Clustering Algorithm

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a K-Means Clustering algorithm. Below is an overview of the project and how to use it.

Contents

K-Means Clustering Algorithm.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file where the K-Means Clustering algorithm is implemented.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.

Model Implementation: Step-by-step construction of a K-Means Clustering algorithm.

Visualization: Graphical representation of clusters and centroids.

Evaluation: Metrics to assess the performance of the clustering algorithm.

Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or above

Jupyter Notebook

Required Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/kmeans-clustering.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd kmeans-clustering

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook "K-Means Clustering Algorithm.ipynb"

Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell and observe the results.

Results

The notebook provides:

Insights into the dataset.

Clusters and their centroids.

Visualizations of the clustered data.

Evaluation metrics such as Silhouette Score and Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS).
